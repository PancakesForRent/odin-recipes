            <p>Making a good grilled cheese sounds like a no brainer,
                but it's actually a great way to headstart your skills
                into the world of cooking! Whether you're a professional chef
                or an avid home cook, a grilled cheese sandwich will surely hit 
                that spot.
            </p>
            <p>A good grilled cheese sandwich means having a perfect golden crust
                on the outside of the bread. What's important also is the melting of
                the cheese. Making sure your bread is toasted and your cheese is melted
                is one of the challenges in making a grilled cheese sandwich. So let's start
                right now on how to cook it perfectly.
