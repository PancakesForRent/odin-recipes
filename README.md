# The Odin Recipes Project

This project will assess my skills in understanding the basic concepts of HTML and Git. After completing this project, I should have demonstrated my abilities to link html files, add images and text, create lists both ordered and unordered, and appropriately use the heading elements.

I also should have practiced my abilities in Git to regularly `git add` and `git commit`, and showing proper creation of git commit messages.
